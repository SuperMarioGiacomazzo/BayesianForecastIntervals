## Introduction



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Example 1
First, consider the generated ARMA(1,0) process

\begin{equation}
y_t=0.3+0.5y_{t-1}+\epsilon_t
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_t \sim N(0,1)$

We can simulate one instance of this process of length T=500
```{r sim1, echo=T}
set.seed(216) #Specify seed for reproducibility
ts.length <- 500 #Length of simulated time series
ts.burn <- ts.length #Length of burn-in period to discard
y <- rnorm(ts.length,0,1) #Initiate vector for time series of length 500
e <- rnorm(ts.length,0,1) #Initiate vector of Gaussian Errors
for(t in 2:ts.length) y[t]=0.3+0.5*y[t-1]+e[t]
```




## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
